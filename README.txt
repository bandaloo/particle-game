Type 'make game' to compile the program.

Copy the include and lib directories of SDL2 into the project folder. On Mac
you can just install them with 'brew install SDL2' and the folders will probably
be located in /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.8/include and
/usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.8/lib respectively. Then just type the make command
and launch particles.

Right now there is not much you can do in the game other than cry.
